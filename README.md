# Sentinel

Sentinel is an automated log-file analysis application for Varian linacs (TrueBeam, Halcyon, Edge). 

# Introduction

Sentinel is capable of monitoring up to 25 linacs simultaneously (maybe more - but that's all I could test) it creates MU map images, akin to fluence, for both the expected mechanical parameters and the actual mechanical delivery parameters. It monitors every MLC, jaw, collimator, gantry, and couch position which is streamed at 20 ms intervals during delivery to a Trajectory Log file. Sentinel automatically and passively processes these files as soon as they are generated by monitoring the TDS directory supplied by the user and it does this by using parallel processing and a job queuing system. It automatically performs gamma analysis on planned and measured fluence MU map images to determine whether what was planned was delivered and can be configured to email you when something fails.

All this data is processed and recorded for every patient, every fraction, and every beam on every linac in a table and CSV file so that some "big data" type analysis can be done, and Sentinel provides the tools to go down this rabbit hole if you wish.

Sentinel also processes incoming RP DICOM plan files that are sent to a different directory that is supplied by the user. I have trained a Sentinel AI on these fluence images against PASS FAIL gamma criteria, with the hope to immediately tell whether a given treatment plan may fail QA before it even being measured or delivered. I'm still testing that though so maybe don't take the AI's word for it just yet!
